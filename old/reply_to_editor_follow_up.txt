Dear Dr. Gossart, 

Thank you for following up on our manuscript "Patterns in the sediment organic matter content of arctic lakes".  We obviously feel that our study has merit and would like to see it published in FAL.  However, we did not feel that the reviews were positive nor that the reviewers could be satisfied with reasonable revisions to the manuscript.  The first reviewer questions the appropriateness of the data that we collected and asserts that without additional data the manuscript is not publishable.  Given the logistics of the study it would not be possible to collect additional seasonal or sediment data.  The second reviewer concludes that the data analysis does not support our conclusions despite acknowledging that they did not have access to the figures.  Reviewer 2 also asks for much more extensive data than are available for these lakes (information on sediment metabolism etc...).  Given these comments, we do not think we could satisfy these reviewers with revisions the manuscript.  

That being said, we believe that our study does provide valuable data on lake sediment characteristics in a relatively understudied part of the world and would be of interest to the readers of FAL.  We acknowledge that our description of the system would be more complete with additional data but we disagree with the current reviewers that our data and analysis are irrevocably flawed.  We would be happy to modify the manuscript to clarify its limitations and strengths however it is impossible at this point to collect more samples.  We would definitely be interested in submitting a revised manuscript for consideration if it could be sent to different reviewers.

Sincerely,
Kenneth Fortino
