Dear Dr. Kenneth Fortino,

you had submitted a version of your manuscript: "Patterns in the sediment organic matter content of arctic lakes" to FAL in September 2012. Although the reviews have been quite positive you have not responded yet. 
Could you please give me a short note and let me know whether you still consider to publish your manuscript in FAL?
Many thanks and best wishes,
yours sincerely
Hans-Peter Grossart
