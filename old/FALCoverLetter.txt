Please find enclosed the manuscript: Patterns in the sediment organic matter content of arctic lakes by Kenneth Fortino, Stephen C. Whalen, and Joseph M. Smoak for submission to Fundamental and Applied Limnology.

In this manuscript we describe patterns in the distribution of sediment organic matter in 22 arctic lakes.  Our analysis of associated environmental factors suggests that variation in benthic primary production has a major influence on the variation in sediment organic matter in shallow arctic lakes.  These findings suggest that changes to lake transparency could alter the storage of organic matter in arctic lake sediments.  Our study also provides 210-Pb dates for the sediments of 3 lakes, expanding the range of these measurements in the region.  

We believe our study will be of interest to the readers of Fundamental and Applied Limnology because we expand basic sediment measurements for arctic lakes that have been incompletely described.  Furthermore, our results highlight the importance of autotrophic processes in the benthos and support the idea that benthic primary production may be an important driver of sediment organic matter dynamics in this region.
