Dear Editor, 

Please find our revised manuscript (HYDR-D-15-00009). We have considered the reviewer comments carefully and have revised to manuscript to incorporate their suggestions. A detailed description of our response to each reviewer written comment is provided below in the section titled ## General Comments. The numbered entries are quoted from the reviewer comments and our response is in the un-numbered paragraph below. We have also gone through the annotations to the manuscript and incorporated those changes as needed. A description of those changes are in the section titled ## Comments in the Manuscript.


## General Comments

1. "a single water column profile to define photosynthetic activity and light attenuation for the lake. This data is then compared to sediment OM that represents multiple years of accumulation. Paleolimnologists often make these time-transgressive comparisons (e.g. for paleoecological training sets), so I'm not saying the author's should remove it, but this should be acknowledged in the paper."

In accordance with the reviewer suggestion we acknowledge in the Discussion that our comparison of dissolved oxygen, transparency, and sediment organic matter is complicated by the fact that these processes vary across different time scales [lines 284 - 285].

2. Shallow and deep areas of a lake integrate very different amounts of sediment due to focusing (acknowledged in the paper L284). So in reality there are multiple timescales being directly compared between the shallow and deep cores. It's likely that the slow sediment accumulation and large sample smooths out much of the variability within the lake, which is why the deep and shallow sites are so similar. This should acknowledged somewhere in the paper.

The reviewer identifies a valid alternative explanation for the lack of variability between the sediment percent organic matter of the sediments from the shallow and deep portions of the lake. As suggested by the reviewer, we acknowledge the possibility that focusing may obscure differences between the percent organic matter of the sediments from the shallow and deep portions of the lake in our sampling in the Discussion [lines 273 - 278].

3. Dating: Are there any 137Cs results that could be used to help with the chronology? I don't think the CIC is the right model. To use the CIC model you should have a monotonic trend in 210Pb which does not appear to be the case. This is exemplified in core GTH91, where it appears that 210Pb is near background at around 6cm probably representing the 150 year limit of this radioisotope based on a half-life of 22.3 years.

We disagree with the reviewer comments on our use of the CIC model for our sediment cores. The reviewer indicates that Lake GTH 91 does not have a monotonic trend, however the exponential curve of the Pb210 activity fit to the profile from lake GTH 91 has an R2 of 0.98, which indicates that it is appropriate for the CIC model. The remaining lakes show some mixing near the surface but the model was not fit to the upper portion of the core that showed mixing. For lakes E-4 and S-3, the model has an R2 of 0.96 and 0.93 respectively. To clarify these points we indicate in the methods that the CIC model was only used for the portion of the profile that showed no evidence of mixing [line 150].  Furthermore we added the exponential model fit data to the results to provide information on the appropriateness of the model [lines 206 - 208]. Finally, we do not feel that the 137Cs is appropriate for these sediments because Cs is mobile in organic sediments and therefore would provide an unreliable peak for date estimates.


4. The dry mass accumulation rate (DMAR) is not focus-corrected. In order to compare the DMAR from one lake to another you need to account for focusing to the core site. This impacts your calculations on OM storage (L237-242 and L246-249) but probably does not impact your calculations on OM diagenesis (L233-237). To focus-correct the accumulation rates use the cumulative unsupported 210Pb flux and compare to the atmospheric 210Pb flux for the region, this is your "focus factor". For the atmospheric 210Pb flux I suggest looking at Lamborg et al (2013. Sci Tot Env 448:132-140) or contacting Dan Engstrom at the St. Croix Watershed Research Station, Science Museum or Minnesota.

We agree with the reviewer that sediment focusing could introduce some bias into our estimate of sediment accumulation rate but we do not feel that calculating the focusing factor for these lakes would add additional clarity to our estimates.  Our sediment accumulation rates are based on only 2 cores from the deepest portion of the lake. As a result, we are in reality comparing one sampling site in a lake to another sampling site in another lake. In doing this, we are assuming that our sampling site is representative of the whole lake but recognize that there is error associated with the assumption. Any calculation of focusing factor would have the uncertainly associated with this assumption added to the uncertainly associated with estimating the atmospheric Pb-210 flux in the region of the lakes. Considering the magnitude of these uncertainties, we do not feel that this specific calculation would add any meaningful rigor to our estimates. To clarify this uncertainty in the paper, we added a description of the assumptions we are making to the Discussion [lines 243 - 247].


5. The ages of the cores range from 60-150 yrs. GÃ¤lman et al (2008. Limnol Oceanogr 53:1076-1082) showed that C is probably not lost much after the first 5 years following deposition. I don't think the trend in %OM you find reflects continued OM diagenesis, just variations in benthic production. Meaning I'm skeptical of the calculated OM diagenesis/loss rates (Table 3).

We certainly agree with the reviewer that patterns in organic matter with depth result from the combined effects of deposition and mineralization. On line 215 we indicate that our estimate of organic matter loss rates requires the assumption of a constant sediment accumulation rate and so we feel that we make clear the limitations of our estimate. We further develop this point when we discuss the lack of evidence of organic matter loss with depth in GTH 91 on line 261, where we acknowledge that changes in the input of organic matter to the sediments over time can affect the attribution of organic matter loss to mineralization. The reviewer cites Galman et al 2008 to indicate that organic matter is not mineralized significantly after 5 years in the sediment but we feel that the results of Galman et al are not necessarily representative of our study system. Galman et al. 2008 studied a varve lake that would be subject to much different sedimentation and mineralization patterns than the lakes in our study.  Based on the organic matter content of our cores, we clearly show that organic matter was lost with depth. Since we also have sedimentation rates estimated from the 210-Pb analysis, we report the loss rate per year.  

## Comments in the Manuscript

Line 26 - Corrected the word order as suggested by the reviewer.

Line 28 - Replaced "photosynthesis rates" with "production" as suggested by the reviewer.

Line 59 - The reviewer questions whether a source referencing marine sediments is appropriate given that our study is in freshwater. In this statement in the manuscript we are simply defining the endpoint of organic matter mineralization on geologic time scales. We feel that given the very broad nature of the point that we are making, combined with the fact that over geologic time, there would be little difference between marine and freshwater processes, that this reference is appropriate.

Line 70 - Corrected the typo pointed out by the reviewer.

Line 149 - Our use of 210-Pb rather than 137-Cs is explained in point 3 above.

Line 174 - The reviewer questions whether the data were transformed. The data were not transformed.

Line 266 - We corrected the error in Table 1 identified by the reviewer.

Line 312 - We replaced "euphotic" with "littoral" as suggested by the reviewer. Littoral is not as technically correct but does not substantially change the meaning of the statement and is less likely to cause confusion.

Line 314 - The reviewer suggests that we evaluate the organic matter profile from Lake N-1 to support our supposition that the experimental fertilization may have created the increase in sediment organic matter in the shallow-water sediments. This was a good suggestion and the evaluation shows that it is very unlikely that the fertilization caused this increase because the difference is evident all the way to the base of the core. Therefore, we have removed this as a potential explanation.

Line 323 - Corrected typo identified by the reviewer.

Line 331 - Replaced "constrained" with "minor" as suggested by the reviewer.
